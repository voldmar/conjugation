	     FREE EDUCATION INITIATIVE LICENSE


PREAMBLE

  The philosophy of the Free Education Initiative License 
is simple: Education should be free, and every individual 
has a basic right to improve themselves through education.  
However, with the advent of the technology age, many individuals 
around the globe are denied access to educational software tools 
due to their inability to purchase high-priced commercial software.
For many fields of study, only commercial educational tools 
are available, tools which can neither be modified by members 
of the general public to furnish improvements, or be adapted 
to other fields of study and operating systems. Often, such 
commercial tools are highly censored, violating the concepts 
of 'free speech' and 'free education'. In other cases, commercial  
programs do not conform to societal standards, governmental laws, 
or parental standards for 'appropriate' education for children, 
making the tools illegal to use in a particular region or jurisdiction, 
or undesirable for parents and teachers. To remain useful, 
educational software must be kept free and open source, to 
allow for modifications and improvements, adaptations to 
existing and emerging fields of study, and accomodations to 
a wide variety of forever-changing needs, laws, social standards, 
and family values around the globe.  The goals of this license 
are:  
	1. To keep educational software free-of-charge, open 
	    source, and publicly accessible to all members of the 
	    general public   
	2. To keep software distributed under this license from 
	    being absorbed under 'closed-source', commercial, or 
	    proprietary software licenses and patents, which grant 
	    the right to an education to a select few, and inhibit 
	    education for many
	3. To encourage, but not require, the development 
	    of educational software that is flexible, adaptable, 
	    and mindful of widely varied laws, family 
	    values, social norms, and computing 
	    systems around the world.
	4. To protect, as much as possible, the privacy of 
	    of end-users
	5.  To protect authors of free educational software 
	     from frivolous law suits and legal penalties


BASIC CONCEPTS OF THIS LICENSE

  The Free Education Initiative License is designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of this software, that you receive 
source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software 
or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do 
these things.

  To protect your rights, certain restrictions are in place to forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of this program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get 'publicly
accessible' complete source code from a 'publicly accessible' location.  You 
must show them these terms and provide them with a copy of this license, 
the Free Education Initiative License, so they know their rights.

  Your rights are protected with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection, there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, the
recipients must be informed that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the reputation
of the original author(s).

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  This license seeks to avoid the danger that redistributors of 
a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, as a term of this license, any
patent must be licensed under the Free Education Initiative License, 
or not licensed at all.

  This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this Free Education Initiative License.  The "Program", 
below, refers to any such program or work.  A "work based on the 
Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright 
law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

  Activities other than copying, distribution, and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing, or modifying
the Program or works based on it.


DEFINITIONS, AS USED IN THIS LICENSE

  "Source code": 
	The source code for a work means the preferred form 
	of the work for making modifications to it, generally a 
	text-based, machine-readable form.  
  "Complete source": 
	Complete source code means all the source code for all 
	modules, libraries, components, and executables a work contains, 
	plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts 
	used to control compilation and installation of the work. 
 	However, as a special exception, the complete source code need 
	not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or 
	binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and 
	so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, 
	unless that component itself accompanies the executable.
  "Publicly accessible":
	To be publicly accessible means to be available to members 
	of the general public, without discrimination of any kind, 
	through resources and tools which are both free-of-charge and 
	commonly-used.  Members of the general public should be 
	granted uninhibited access to the resource. In addition, in order 
	to be publicly accessible, a resource MUST NOT REQUIRE, as a 
	prerequisite to unfettered access, any of the following: 

		a.  The payment of a fee or royalty of any kind, whether 
		     for the resource itself or for the software tools 
		     needed to access said resource
		b.  A relationship or affiliation, with any particular person, 
		     group, organization, or corporate entity (For example, 
		    'customers only' and 'employees only' policies)
		c. The procurement or existence of a password, 
		    access code, membership, or other 
		    credentials (For example, 'members only' policies)
		d. The procurement or presence of decryption 
		    mechanisms, software, or tools
		e. The presence of any one particular operating 
		    system, major operating system component, or 
		    web browser  (For example, a resource only 
		    accessible to users of Windows, or a resource 
		    only available to Netscape users)
		f.  The procurement of additional resources, including
		    but not limited to, software, if such resources are
		    obscure, difficult or cumbersome to obtain, or require 
		    the payment a fee or royalty of any kind (For example, 
		    file formats which may ONLY be opened through the aid 
		    of a purchased software tool.)
		g. The release of an individual's personal information (For 
		    example, requiring a user to provide an email address, 
		    real name, postal adddress, or phone number)
		h.  A request for access, whether written, electronic, or oral
		    (For example, if an individual has to get their access
		    'approved' ahead of time, or can only receive software 
		    by making a request by email, phone, or postal mail.)
		i.   Access to an intranet, internal network, computer, or 
		    terminal which is private, has 'restricted access', or is 
		    otherwise not accessible to all members of the general 
		    public, or is only accessible to individuals in a particular 
		    geographical or physical location
		j.  Knowledge of relatively obscure or obsolete internet 
		    protocols or software tools if more customary alternatives
		    are available  (For example, distributing software via 
		    the Gopher or UUCP protocols, when HTTP and FTP 
		    are more popular among members of the general public.)
  "Open source":
	Software for which the 'complete source code' is available to the
	general public in a 'publicly accessible' manner, and in a 
	'publicly accessible' location
  "Closed source": 
	Software for which the 'complete source code' is NOT available to 
	the general public in both a 'publicly accessible' manner and a 
	'publicly accessible' location; this includes, but is not limited to, 
	software such as freeware, shareware, or commercial software, 
	or any other software for which only binary or machine-compiled 
	copies are available to the general public, regardless of whether 
	said software requires the end-users to pay royalties or fees.
  "Proprietary software": 
	In the context of this license, proprietary software includes all 
	'closed source' software, as well as any software for which 
	the payment of a fee or royalty, of any kind, is a prerequisite 
	to obtaining the 'complete source code' for the software, or  
	software whose 'complete source code' is made available on 
	a 'read-only' basis, either by prohibiting any and all modifications 
	to the 'complete source code' by the general public, or by deeming 
	completely illegal, without exception, the distribution of copies 
	modified by members of the general public.
  "Package": 
	A single, compressed file archive containing all the components 
	and documentation for a software work


TERMS OF USE

  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to use this 
Program and its documentation without restriction. Usage 
does NOT include modification, distribution, or 
redistribution, which are covered in subsequent sections 
of this License.


TERMS OF MODIFICATION

  Permission is hereby granted to freely modify this Program. Any 
modification of this Program constitutes a "work based on the 
Program", as previously defined in this License. Modification does 
NOT include distribution, which is covered in the section to follow. 
ANY work based on this Program automatically inherits this 
License; that is to say, no work based on this Program can be 
licensed under any license except the Free Education Initiative 
License. Any work based on this Program is licensed exclusively 
under the Free Education Initiative License, and may not be 
sub-licensed or re-licensed, in any way.


TERMS OF DISTRIBUTION AND REDISTRIBUTION

A.  Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a Free Education
Initiative License from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify 
the Program subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose 
any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted 
herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties 
to this License.

B.  Mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.  For instance, including this Program on a 
CD-ROM collection of software, does not bring the other software 
under the scope of this license.

C.  You may incorporate parts of this Program into another program 
whose license or distribution terms are different; however, you 
are forbidden from distributing, without exception, the new work.
If you wish to distribute the work, you must either license the 
new work, as a whole and in its entirety, exclusively under the 
Free Education Initiative License, or refrain from using any parts 
of this Program in the new work.

D.  You are strictly forbidden from charging anyone a royalty or 
fee of any kind for this Program or any work based on this 
Program, or for full, unfettered access to this Program or any 
work based on this Program, with the following exceptions:
	
	1. You may charge the recipient(s) if this Program (or a 
	    work based on it) is being issued to the 
	    recipient(s) as part of a distributed collection 
	    of software comprised EXCLUSIVELY of software 
	    licensed under one of the following: 

			1) This license, the Free Education Initiative License
			2) An OSI-approved license, as defined at the Open 
				Source Initiative web site: http://www.opensource.org

	    The cost to the recipient(s) may not exceed your cost of 
	    physically performing the distribution of the collection of 
	    software.  This Program may not be sold or resold to 
	    the recipient(s) for a profit of any kind.

	2. You may charge the recipient(s) if this Program is part 
	    of a distributed collection of software which provides 
	    the recipient(s) with a means of installing exactly one 
	    fully-functioning operating system, provided that the 
	    operating system being provided to the recipient(s) 
	    is licensed EXCLUSIVELY under an OSI-approved license, 
	    as defined at the Open Source Initiative web site: 
	    		http://www.opensource.org
	    Proprietary and 'Closed-Source' operating systems do 
	    not qualify under this provision.

E.  At your choosing, you may offfer to the recipient(s), either 
free-of-charge or for a fee, a warranty or technical support for 
this Program (or a work based on this Program).  However, 
the purchase of such warranty or technical support may NOT 
be a prerequisite to the recipient(s) having complete, unfettered 
access to at least one 'Publicly Accessible' copy of the 
'Complete Source Code' for this Program (or a work based 
on this Program).  

	
  Distribution of verbatim, unmodified copies of this Program:

	    Permission is hereby granted to freely copy, publish, 
	    and distribute verbatim, unmodified copies of this 
	    Program, provided you do so in a manner that complies with
	    sections A, B, C, D, and E, above.  If you distribute binary 
	    or machine-compiled copies of this Program, you MUST 
            make 'Complete Source Code' for this Program available 
	    to the recipient(s) by doing at least one of the following:
		
	    	1. Distribute a copy of the 'Complete Source Code' for this 
	            Program, either in the same 'package' as the binary 
                    copy, or in a seperate 'package' distributed along with 
	    	    the binary copy on the same storage medium. 
			(The term 'storage medium' includes fixed or 
			removable storage disks of any kind, as well as any
			network-based or internet-based servers or storage 
			systems.)

		2.  Provide, in the end-user documentation for the Program, 
		    accurate, clear information on how to obtain at least one
			'Publicly Accessible' copy of the 'Complete Source Code' for 
			this Program. The 'Publicly Accessible' copy must comply 
		    with the terms set forth in this license, under the section 
			'Publicly Accessible Complete Source Code'.

			
  Distribution of works based on this Program:

	    Permission is hereby granted to freely distribute works
	    based on this Program, provided you do so in a manner 
	    which completely complies with sections A, B, C, D, 
	    and E, above.  In addition, the following stipulations 
	    apply to the distribution of works based on this Program.
	    Herein, the term 'derived work' is identical in meaning 
	    to a 'work based on this Program':

		1. You may not distribute any derived work which 
			utilizes, includes, or in any way relies upon 
			'Closed Source' or 'Proprietary' software or 
			components.		

		2. You may not distribute any derived work which 
			utilizes, includes, or in any way relies upon 
			software or other components which are not 			
			distributed under one of the following licenses:
				1) This license, the Free Education Initiative License
				2) An OSI-approved license, as defined at the Open 
				    Source Initiative web site: http://www.opensource.org			
				3) Public Domain	 
				4) Another license which grants unrestricted rights to use, 
					copy, modify, and distribute the 'Complete Source 
					Code' for the software or component(s) for, at a
					bare minimum, educational use, research use, and 
					home/personal use. In addition, said license must not 
					require the payment of a royalty or fee for these rights.

		3. You must include a clearly written description and date of 
			all the modifications, additions, and subtractions you 
			made to this Program, either in each modified source file, 
			or in a seperate plain text file included with the end-user 
			documentation for your derived work. Having satisfied this 
			requirement, you may also, at your choosing, freely list such 
			modifications in additional locations, and in the formats of 
			your choice.

		4. You must share your derived work with everybody, or 
			nobody at all.  You may not, under any circumstances, 
			distribute your derived work to a select few, as doing 
			so constitutes the usage of this Program to create a 
			Proprietary work, the distribution of which is strictly 
			prohibited under the terms of this License agreement. 
			Specifically, you MUST make available to the general 
			public at least one 'Publicly Accessible' copy of the 
			'Complete Source Code' for your derived work. The 
			'Publicly Accessible' copy must comply with the terms 
			set forth in this license, under the section 'Publicly 
			Accessible Complete Source Code'.

		5.  Herein, the terms 'extension' and 'plug-in' refer to 
			software or components which are not required 
			for the proper functioning of a derived work, but 
			may be used by the derived work to enhance the 
			features or functionality of the derived work.  If your 
			derived work makes use of any 'extension' or 'plug-in',
			you must ensure that this same enhanced 
			functionality is available to the general public. You may 
			not distribute 'enhanced' copies of your derived 
			work to some individuals, while distributing only 
			'bare-bones' copies to the general public. 
			Specifically, for each 'extension' or 'plug-in' your 
			derived work utilizes, you MUST make available to 
			the general public at least one 'Publicly Accessible' 
			copy of the 'Complete Source Code' for said 'extension'
			or 'plug-in'.  Each 'Publicly Accessible' copy must 
			comply with the terms set forth in this license, 
			under the section 'Publicly Accessible Complete 
			Source Code'.  You must satisfy this 
			requirement by doing at least one of the 
			following:
		
	    			i. Distribute, along with the derived work, a copy of 
				  the 'Complete Source Code' for each 'extension' 
				  or 'plug-in', either in the same 'package' as 
				  the derived work, or in one or more 'packages'.
				  The derived work and any relevant 'extensions'
				  or 'plug-ins', must be stored at the same location
				  on an HTTP, FTP, or CVS server, in accordance 
				  with the terms set forth in the section 'Publicly 
				  Accessible Complete Source Code'.

				ii. Provide, in the end-user documentation for the 
				   derived work, accurate, clear information on 
				   how to obtain at least one 'Publicly Accessible' copy 
				   of the 'Complete Source Code' for each 'extension'
				   or 'plug-in'.  Each 'Publicly Accessible' copy must 
				   comply with the terms set forth in this license, 
				   under the section 'Publicly Accessible Complete 
				   Source Code'.

			If, for whatever reason, the 'Complete Source 
			Code' for an 'extension' or 'plug-in' cannot be 
			made available to the general public in 
			accordance with this requirement, you must 
			either eliminate your derived work's use of 
			the 'extension' or 'plug-in', or refrain from 
			distributing your derived work altogether. The 
			distribution of derived works which utilize 
			'closed source' or proprietary enhancements, 
			'plug-ins', or 'extensions' is prohibited.

		6. If you distribute binary (machine-compiled) copies of 
			the derived work, you MUST make available to the 
			recipients(s) an identical copy of the exact same 
			'Complete Source Code' used to generate the 
			binary you distribute, by doing at least one of the 
			following:
		
	    			i. Distribute a copy of the 'Complete Source Code' 
				  for the derived work, either in the same 'package' as 
				  the binary copy, or in a seperate 'package' 
				  distributed along with the binary copy on the 
				  same storage medium.  (The term 'storage medium' 
				  includes fixed or removable storage disks of 
				  any kind, as well as any network-based or 
				  internet-based servers or storage systems.)

				ii. Provide, in the end-user documentation for the 
				   derived work, accurate, clear information on 
				   how to obtain at least one 'Publicly Accessible' copy 
				   of the 'Complete Source Code' for the derived work. 
				   The 'Publicly Accessible' copy must comply with the 
				   terms set forth in this license, under the section 
				   'Publicly Accessible Complete Source Code'.
	    

  If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.


PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE COMPLETE SOURCE CODE

Some basic rules are in place to ensure that the greatest  
number of people have unfettered access to 'Complete Source 
Code' for this Program (or any work based on this Program), as 
well as any 'extensions' or 'plug-ins' utilized by this Program  (or any 
work based on this Program).

	1. The location of the 'Complete Source Code' must be 
	    a customary, widely-adopted storage medium, and 
	    must completely satisfy the definition of 'Publicly 
            Accessible', as previously defined in this License. 
	    Currently, the following storage methods satisfy 
	    this requirement, though this is not an exhaustive 
	    list:

		a.  HTTP: Otherwise known as the world-wide 
			web.  You may provide a valid HTTP 
			Uniform Resource Locator (or URL) 
			pointing to an HTML web page that
			contains a direct link to the 'package' of 
			'Complete Source Code'.  Uniform Resource 
			Locators or links which use the Secure 
			HTTP protocol (i.e. links that begin with 
			"https://"), are NOT acceptable.  The 
			encryption software required by web browsers 
			to access the Secure HTTP protocol is 
			illegal to export to certain countries, thus 
			making such links inaccessible for many 
			individuals.  Links to 'packages' of 
			'Complete Source Code' should 
			be clearly marked as such and should 
			appear on HTML-based web pages which 
			are, as mush as possible, accessible to 
			all web browsers and meet the definition 
			of 'Publicly Accessible'.  'Packages' of 
			'Complete Source Code' which are stored 
			on HTTP servers, but not linked to from 
			at least one HTML-based web page, are 
			NOT acceptable. The 'Complete Source Code' 
			must be stored as a single 'package', as 
			defined previously in this License.

		b.  FTP:  Otherwise known as the File Transfer
			Protocol.  You may provide a valid FTP 
			Uniform Resource Locator (or URL) that 
			links directly to the 'package' of 
			'Complete Source Code' itself, or a URL 
			that links to the immediate parent 
			directory of the 'package'.  Links to 'warez' 
			servers, or FTP servers which store pirated 
			or illegally-obtained materials, are NOT 
			acceptable.  The 'Complete Source Code' 
			must be stored as a single 'package', as 
			defined previously in this License.

		c.  CVS: Otherwise known as the Concurrent 
			Version System. You may provide a copy 
			of the 'Complete Source Code' as a source 'tree'
			on a publicly accessible CVS server, provided 
			that all members of the general public are 
			granted unrestricted, anonymous access 
			to the portion(s) of the CVS server which 
			house the 'Complete Source Code'.  Clearly 
			written information detailing how to access 
			the CVS server and obtain the 'Complete 
			'Source Code' should be displayed in a public, 
			highly visible location, such as a web page.
			A source 'tree', when stored on a CVS server, 
			qualifies as a 'package'.

	    'Packages' of 'Complete Source Code' should be stored on 
	    a server whose Internet Protocol (IP) address is static.	   
	    'Packages' stored on servers connected to the internet 
	    by means of a dial-up connection are NOT acceptable, as 
	    their availability is highly unpredictable.

	2. The 'Complete Source Code' must be stored in a 
	    widely-adopted file format that complies with the 
	    definition of 'Publicly Accessible', as defined previously 
	    in this License:

		a. If the 'Complete Source Code' is stored on a CVS 
			server, the most suitable file format for public 
			distribution is a source 'tree', housed under a 
			single CVS 'module' or directory.

		b. If the 'Complete Source Code' is stored on an HTTP
			or FTP server, the 'Complete Source Code' should 
			be compressed, but not encrypted or password-
			protected, into a single 'package'. The file format 
			of the 'package' must meet the definiton of 
			'Publicly Accessible'.  Currently, the following file 
			formats most fit this definition, though this is not 
			intended to be an exhaustive list:
			
				- .zip   (Zip format)
				- .tar.gz  (Tar-GZipped format)
				. .tar  (Tar format)
				- .gz  (GZip format)
				- .jar  (Java Archive format) 
				- .tar.bz2  (Tar-BZipped format)
				- .rar  (RAR format)

			You must avoid, at all costs, storing a 'publicly 
			accessible' 'package' of 'Complete Source Code' 
			in a file format which cannot be read or 
			extracted, through normal means, on all 
			modern operating systems.  For instance, 
			'Complete Source Code' stored in RPM or Debian 
			format is NOT 'publicly accessible' to most 
			users of BeOs or MacIntosh.  Under NO 
			circumstances is it permissible to store a 
			a 'package' of 'publicly accessible' 'Complete 
			Source Code' in a file format which can only be 
			read, opened, or extracted, through customary 
			means, by EXACTLY ONE operating system.  
			For instance, a 'package' of 'Complete Source 
			Code' stored inside a Windows Cabinet (.cab) 
			file is NOT publicly accessible to everyone. 
			You must choose a popular, customary, and 
			widely-adopted file format that is readable 
			on all modern operating systems.

	3. You may, of course, at your choosing, make additional 
	    'packages' of 'Complete Source Code' available in any 
	    location(s) and any file format(s) of your choice.  However, 
	    you are obligated to make available to the general public 
	    at least ONE 'package' of 'Complete Source Code' 
	    that complies with both sections 1 and 2, above, to 
	    ensure that this Program (or any work based on it) 
	    remains 'Open Source' for everyone.


ENDORSEMENTS AND ADVERTISEMENTS

  The name(s) of the author(s) of this Program may not
be used to endorse or promote works or products derived

from the author(s).


TRANSLATION OF THIS LICENSE

You may freely translate this license to other languages, provided that
you translate verbatim, as much as is possible, the exact meaning of 
this license in its entirety, without additions or supplements, and without 
modifications to the meanings or implied meanings of this license. In the 
event of any conflict between a translated copy of the license, and the 
original English-language version of the license, the original English-language

REQUESTS

  It is requested, but not required, that you make every effort to 
be mindful of diverse social norms and family values around 
the globe should you decide to distribute a work based on 
this Program.  As this License was written with educational 
and research software in mind, the following is requested, 
though not required:  If your derived work contains content 
which may be considered 'inappropriate' for children or offensive 
to some cultures, please leave any existing methods in place 
which give end-users the ability to disable or remove such 
content, replace such methods with comparable or better 
methods that accomplish the same task, or give end-users 
an option to obtain copies of your work which exclude such 
content.  Again, this is not a requirement or obligation, but 
merely a request that you respect diverse cultures and values.
